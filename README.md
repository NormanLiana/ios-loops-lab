}

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// This will be an infinite loop. The loop says that while "i" (which is a variable and its value is 5) is greater than 3 run this code in the loop--> "i" plus 1 equals new "i" which in the first loop would return a number of 6 to update "i" to 6. The loop would then run again because 6 is greater than 3 and this will continue on because in the statement of the loop we are always adding 1 to "i" so it will always be more than 3 in the condition meaning the loop will run over and over and will not stop.
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
i += 1
if i == 9 {
break
}
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
i += 1
if i == 1005 {
break
}
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
i += 1
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)
}
else if i == 1005 {
break
}
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10

The syntax for loop one will check if the condition of the loop is true prior to running the loop whereas loop two repeats the loop prior to checking if the condition is true. Both loops have the same output because they both have the same statement for the loop as well as the same condition to check against its truth. They just check the condition and repeat the loop in a different order.
```

***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

"Break" tells you to completely stop the execution of a loop/if/switch and to not perform it again if it is false. Whereas "continue" tells you to not execute that iteration of the loop when the statement is false. It will continue to the next iteration and not completely terminate the loop.

// Continue example

var example = 2

while example < 7 {
example += 1
if example == 6 {
continue
}
print("\(example)")
}

// Break example

var example = 2

while example < 7 {
example += 1
if example == 6 {
break
}
print("\(example)")
}

***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```
//THIS CODE WILL NOT PRINT ANYTHING

***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}

//Answer below

x = 1, y = 1
x = 2, y = 1
x = 3, y = 1
```

***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 21

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
